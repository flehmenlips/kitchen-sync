## What We Accomplished Today

### 1. ✅ Fixed Database Schema Issues

### 2. ✅ Implemented Module System

- Renamed "Restaurant Settings" → "Website Builder"

### 3. ✅ Set Up Subdomain Routing
- Configured DNS records for main domain and subdomains
- Added wildcard subdomain support
- Updated CORS to accept subdomain requests
- Fixed API path mismatches (/restaurant-settings → /restaurant)

### 4. ✅ Fixed Website Builder

### 5. ✅ Added Custom Branding
- Created custom KitchenSync favicon (chef's hat design)

## Current Status

### Working:
- ✅ Main domain: https://kitchensync.restaurant
- ✅ API subdomain: https://api.kitchensync.restaurant
- ✅ Website Builder in admin portal
- ✅ All restaurants have slugs

### Pending:
- ⏳ Wildcard subdomain verification in Render
- ⏳ Customer portal access via subdomains

## DNS Configuration

| Host | Type | Points To | Status |
|------|------|-----------|---------|
| @ | A | 216.24.57.1 | ✅ Working |
| www | CNAME | kitchen-sync-app.onrender.com | ✅ Working |
| api | CNAME | kitchen-sync-api.onrender.com | ✅ Working |
| * | CNAME | kitchen-sync-app.onrender.com | ⏳ Pending verification |

## Next Steps

1. Update verification records to point to `app` instead of `api`
2. Click "Verify" in Render once DNS propagates
3. Test customer portals at subdomains
4. Consider implementing subdomain-based branding

## Restaurant URLs (Once Working)

- Coq au Vin: https://coq-au-vin.kitchensync.restaurant
- Sea Breeze: https://seabreeze-kitchen.kitchensync.restaurant
- And 14 more restaurants with their own subdomains!
