## Research: Recipe Web Scraping Libraries

Based on research into available libraries for recipe web scraping, here are the recommended options for implementing URL import functionality:

### 1. Recipe Schema Extraction Libraries

#### Cheerio + JSON-LD Schema Processing
**Recommendation:** Build a custom solution using Cheerio for HTML parsing and direct JSON-LD extraction.

**Benefits:**
- Cheerio is a lightweight, fast jQuery-like library for server-side HTML parsing
- JSON-LD is the most common and reliable recipe schema format on modern recipe sites
- Direct control over scraping logic and error handling
- No external dependencies on potentially unmaintained libraries

**Example Implementation:**
```javascript
import cheerio from 'cheerio';
import axios from 'axios';

async function scrapeRecipeFromUrl(url) {
  try {
    // Fetch the HTML content from the URL
    const response = await axios.get(url);
    const html = response.data;
    
    // Load HTML into Cheerio
    const $ = cheerio.load(html);
    
    // Extract JSON-LD data
    const jsonLdScript = $('script[type="application/ld+json"]').html();
    
    if (jsonLdScript) {
      const jsonLdData = JSON.parse(jsonLdScript);
      
      // Handle different JSON-LD structures
      const recipeData = Array.isArray(jsonLdData) 
        ? jsonLdData.find(item => item['@type'] === 'Recipe')
        : jsonLdData['@type'] === 'Recipe' 
          ? jsonLdData 
          : jsonLdData['@graph']?.find(item => item['@type'] === 'Recipe');
      
      if (recipeData) {
        return {
          name: recipeData.name,
          description: recipeData.description,
          ingredients: recipeData.recipeIngredient,
          instructions: processInstructions(recipeData.recipeInstructions),
          cookTime: recipeData.cookTime,
          prepTime: recipeData.prepTime,
          totalTime: recipeData.totalTime,
          yield: recipeData.recipeYield,
          image: recipeData.image,
          url: url,
          sourceWebsite: new URL(url).hostname
        };
      }
    }
    
    // Fallback to other extraction methods if needed
    // ...
    
    throw new Error('No recipe data found on page');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Recipe scraping error:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to scrape recipe: ' + error.message);
  }
}

// Helper to process recipe instructions which may be in different formats
function processInstructions(instructions) {
  if (!instructions) return [];
  
  if (typeof instructions === 'string') return [instructions];
  
  if (Array.isArray(instructions)) {
    return instructions.map(instruction => {
      if (typeof instruction === 'string') return instruction;
      if (instruction['@type'] === 'HowToStep') return instruction.text;
      return instruction.text || instruction.name || '';
    }).filter(Boolean);
  }
  
  return [];
}
```

### 2. Existing Recipe Scraper Libraries

#### Option A: recipe-data-scraper
**Description:** Node.js library specifically designed for recipe extraction from websites

**Benefits:**
- Focused solely on recipe data extraction
- Supports microdata and JSON-LD formats
- Active development and 15 GitHub stars
- Clean API with Promise-based usage

**Limitations:**
- Limited website coverage compared to custom solutions
- Possible maintenance concerns for long-term usage

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
import recipeDataScraper from 'recipe-data-scraper';

async function getRecipeFromUrl(url) {
  try {
    const recipe = await recipeDataScraper(url);
    return recipe;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Recipe scraping error:', error);
    throw new Error('Could not find recipe data');
  }
}
```

#### Option B: web-auto-extractor
**Description:** Generic semantic data extractor supporting Schema.org vocabularies

**Benefits:**
- Supports multiple formats (Microdata, RDFa-lite, JSON-LD)
- More general-purpose but can be adapted for recipes
- Mature library with good usage documentation

**Limitations:**
- Not recipe-specific, would require additional parsing logic
- Last published 8 years ago (potential maintenance issues)

### 3. Implementation Approach

#### Recommended Implementation Strategy:

1. **Primary Parser:** Build a custom solution using Cheerio and axios for the most reliable extraction:
   - Focus on JSON-LD extraction first (most common format)
   - Add fallback support for Microdata and RDFa
   - Implement schema.org/Recipe detection

2. **Fallback Option:** Integrate recipe-data-scraper as a fallback:
   - Try custom parser first
   - If it fails, attempt with recipe-data-scraper
   - Provide clear error messages for unsupported sites

3. **Data Mapping Layer:**
   - Create a standardized mapping function to convert extracted data to Kitchen Sync's recipe format
   - Normalize units, times, and measurements during conversion
   - Handle edge cases like missing fields

4. **Error Handling and Validation:**
   - Validate scraped data before saving
   - Provide user feedback for partially extracted recipes
   - Allow manual editing of imported recipes

#### Technical Architecture:

```
Backend:
- RecipeScraperService
  |- extractRecipeFromUrl(url) - Main entry point
  |- scrapers/
     |- jsonLdScraper.js - Primary JSON-LD extractor
     |- microdataScraper.js - Fallback microdata extractor
     |- rdfaScraper.js - Fallback RDFa extractor
     |- externalScraperAdapter.js - Adapter for recipe-data-scraper
  |- utils/
     |- schemaNormalizer.js - Converts schema data to Kitchen Sync format
     |- timeParser.js - Handles ISO 8601 duration format conversion
     |- urlValidator.js - Validates and sanitizes input URLs

Frontend:
- ImportRecipeDialog
  |- URL input field with validation
  |- Import progress indicator
  |- Preview of extracted recipe data
  |- Edit capability for corrections
  |- Error handling UI
```

### 4. Testing Strategy

1. Create a test suite with sample HTML from popular recipe websites
2. Include edge cases (missing fields, malformed data)
3. Compare extraction results against expected outputs
4. Implement periodic checks against top recipe websites to ensure continued functionality

### 5. Future Enhancements

1. **Recipe Site Profiles:**
   - Create site-specific extractors for popular recipe websites
   - Handle custom formats not using standard schemas

2. **Machine Learning Enhancement:**
   - Train a model to extract recipe data from non-structured content
   - Improve extraction accuracy for edge cases

3. **Bulk Import:**
   - Support importing multiple recipes from collection pages

The Menu Builder module enables restaurant owners to create, edit, and print professional-looking menus using their existing recipes. This reduces the need to recreate menu items and sections every time the menu is modified.

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Database Schema**: Added models for Menu, MenuSection, and MenuItem with appropriate relations to existing Recipe model
2. **Backend API**: Created RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on menus, sections, and items
3. **Frontend Components**: Developed UI for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting menus
4. **Printing Support**: Designed the module with printing functionality in mind

### Progress Status
- [x] Database schema design and migration SQL creation
- [x] Backend API controllers and routes
- [x] Frontend API service methods
- [x] Frontend menu listing page
- [x] Menu creation/edit form
- [x] Menu sections and items editor component
- [x] Menu detail/preview page with print functionality
- [ ] Recipe selection for menu items (to be implemented)
- [ ] Style customization in the menu editor (to be implemented)
- [ ] Menu PDF export (to be implemented)

### Current Status / Progress Tracking
We've implemented the core functionality of the Menu Builder module. Users can now:
1. View a list of their menus
2. Create new menus with basic information
3. Edit existing menus
4. Add, edit, and delete menu sections
5. Add, edit, and delete menu items within sections
6. Preview menus with formatting based on their settings
7. Print menus directly from the browser

The UI follows a consistent design with the rest of the application and provides a smooth user experience with proper loading states, error handling, and navigation.

Next steps include:
1. Enhancing the menu editor with style customization options
2. Adding a recipe picker to select from existing recipes when creating menu items
3. Implementing PDF export functionality for sharing and offline use
4. Adding logo upload capabilities
5. Improving the print layout with more customization options

### Lessons

- Created relationships between recipes and menu items to reuse recipe data
- Designed the interface with a tab-based form for better organization of complex data
- Used accordions for an intuitive section/item management interface
- Implemented custom print functionality using window.open() and styled HTML
