## Lessons
- Always check for hardcoded constants when implementing dynamic features
- Keep maintenance scripts separate from application code
- Document stashed changes and branch purposes for future reference
- Maintain consistent API endpoint paths across service methods
- Ensure proxy configuration in Vite points to the correct backend server port
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Be aware of how path prefixes are applied in the API service configuration - avoid double prefixing
- Ensure type consistency between frontend and backend, especially for IDs and foreign keys
- Reusable dialog components improve maintainability and consistency
- Adding visual cues for interactive elements improves user experience
- When implementing drag-and-drop, consider both mouse and touch interactions

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Recipe task addition to custom columns has been successfully implemented 
- Both PrepBoard.tsx and RecipeDetail.tsx now use dynamic column selection
- Column CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) are now fully implemented
- Drag-and-drop reordering for columns has been implemented
- The application has been tested locally and functions correctly
- Future enhancement: Consider adding batch operations for tasks (adding multiple recipes at once)

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Maintaining data integrity while allowing custom columns
- Ensuring smooth transition from hardcoded to dynamic column system
- Coordinating database maintenance without disrupting service
- Managing consistent API endpoint configurations between frontend and backend
- Ensuring type consistency between frontend TypeScript interfaces and backend database schema
- Implementing proper drag-and-drop behavior with visual feedback

### Recipe Task Addition Implementation (Priority: High)
- **What**: Implement recipe task addition to prep board columns
- **Why**: Current implementation uses hardcoded columns and outdated task structure
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Components Updated**:
  1. AddRecipeDialog:
     - Removed hardcoded column references
     - Updated to use dynamic column selection
     - Improved error handling and success messaging
     - Added proper type conversion for recipeId (string → number)
  2. RecipeDetail:
     - Removed hardcoded column references
     - Added column selection dialog
     - Improved user feedback on adding tasks
     - Added proper type conversion for recipeId (string → number)
  3. PrepBoard:
     - Added Floating Action Button for adding recipes
     - Integrated AddRecipeDialog component
     - Improved overall user experience
- **Verification**:
  - Users can now add recipes to any custom column 
  - Dynamic column selection implemented in two entry points:
    1. From the Prep Board via the "+" FAB
    2. From a Recipe Detail page via the "Add to Prep Board" button
  - Consistent UX between both methods
  
### API Configuration Fix (Priority: High)
- **What**: Fix API endpoint configuration for prep tasks and columns
- **Why**: Users encountered 404 errors when using the prep board features
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issues Fixed**:
  1. Inconsistent API paths in prepTaskService.ts:
     - `getAllTasks` used `BASE_URL` (/api/prep-tasks)
     - `getTasks` used a different path (/prep-tasks)
  2. Missing `/api` prefix in prepColumnService.ts paths:
     - All endpoint paths were missing the `/api` prefix
     - Added `BASE_URL` constant to ensure consistency
  3. Double `/api` prefix in axios configuration:
     - baseURL in api.ts included `/api` suffix
     - This caused endpoints to have `/api` twice
     - Removed `/api` suffix from baseURL
  4. Incorrect proxy configuration in Vite:
     - Target was set to port 3000 instead of 3001
- **Verification**:
  - Prep board loads columns and tasks correctly
  - Add recipe functionality works correctly from both entry points
  - No 404 errors in console when using prep board features
  
### Type Mismatch Fix (Priority: High)
- **What**: Fix type mismatch between frontend and backend for recipeId
- **Why**: Backend expects recipeId as an integer but frontend was sending it as a string
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issues Fixed**:
  1. Updated the `CreatePrepTaskInput` interface in `prep.ts`:
     - Changed `recipeId` from `string` to `number` type
  2. Modified `AddRecipeDialog.tsx` component:
     - Added explicit conversion of recipe.id to number using parseInt()
  3. Modified `RecipeDetail.tsx` component:
     - Added explicit conversion of recipe.id to number using parseInt()
- **Verification**:
  - Adding recipes to prep board works correctly from both entry points
  - No more 500 internal server errors when adding recipes
  - Server correctly processes the recipe reference and adds tasks to the selected column
