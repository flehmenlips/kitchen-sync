   - Uses existing MenuBuilder data and styling
   - Supports multiple menus with tab navigation
   - Filters to show only active, non-archived content

2. **Restaurant Settings Architecture** (2024-12-20)
   - Comprehensive settings model for all customer-facing content
   - Single source of truth for restaurant information
   - Admin interface planned for easy management
   - Public API endpoint for customer portal access

## Lessons
- Always check for hardcoded constants when implementing dynamic features
- Keep maintenance scripts separate from application code
- Document stashed changes and branch purposes for future reference
- Maintain consistent API endpoint paths across service methods
- Ensure proxy configuration in Vite points to the correct backend server port
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Be aware of how path prefixes are applied in the API service configuration - avoid double prefixing
- Ensure type consistency between frontend and backend, especially for IDs and foreign keys
- When implementing complex systems, document the architecture and user roles first
- Separate customer-facing and internal-facing interfaces from the start
- Plan for multi-tenancy early in the project to avoid major refactoring later
- Start with single-tenant MVP to validate concept before adding complexity
- Use clear restaurant branding in customer-facing interfaces
- Implement multi-step forms for better UX in reservation flow
- Create comprehensive settings models to avoid hardcoding throughout the app
- Always regenerate Prisma client after schema changes
- Always use `npm run dev:local` in the backend - This uses `.env.local` which points to the local database. Never use `npm run dev` as it uses `.env` which connects to the production database!
- CORS Configuration - When using authentication with JWT tokens, always ensure:
  - Backend has `credentials: true` in CORS config
  - Frontend has `withCredentials: true` in axios config
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- **Separate Customer and Staff Authentication** - Always use separate axios instances and auth storage for customer vs staff to avoid:
  - Shared authorization headers causing cross-authentication
  - Wrong redirects (customers going to staff login)
  - Mixed authentication states
- **Customer Auth Context Issues** - When using customer authentication:
  - Initialize auth state from storage in useState to avoid losing auth on route changes
  - Use the context's login method instead of calling the service directly in components
  - Ensure the CustomerAuthProvider persists across route changes (wrap parent layout, not individual routes)
  - Add small delays after login to ensure state updates before navigation
- **Database Safety - CRITICAL**: 
  - NEVER use `dotenv -e .env.local -- command` syntax as it may fail and load production `.env` instead
  - ALWAYS use npm scripts that explicitly load `.env.local` (e.g., `npm run prisma:studio`, `npm run dev:local`)
  - ALWAYS verify database connection before any operations using `npm run db:check`
  - Production database URLs contain `render.com`, `amazonaws.com`, etc. - local URLs contain `localhost`
  - If you see production data when expecting test data, STOP immediately
  - Use `pkill -f prisma` as emergency kill switch
  - Create visual distinctions (terminal colors, prompts) between prod and dev environments

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Port Configuration Issues Investigation (2024-12-28)

**Issue**: Customer account creation is experiencing issues related to port confusion between 5173 and 5174.

**Findings**:
1. **Frontend Port Configuration**:
   - Vite config does not specify a port (defaults to 5173)
   - Package.json dev script runs `vite` without port specification
   - Frontend can run on different ports depending on availability

2. **Backend Configuration**:
   - CORS is configured with: `process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:5173'`
   - Email verification URL uses: `${process.env.FRONTEND_URL}/verify-email?token=${verificationToken}`
   - This means `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable must be set correctly

3. **Current Issues**:
   - No .env files found in workspace (may be gitignored)
   - FRONTEND_URL must match the actual port where frontend is running
   - If frontend starts on 5174 (when 5173 is busy), but FRONTEND_URL points to 5173, verification links will fail

**Database Query Results**:
- Unable to view customer accounts directly via CLI
- Prisma Studio launched in background for manual inspection

**Recommendations**:
1. **Immediate Fix**:
   - Check which port frontend is actually running on
   - Update FRONTEND_URL environment variable to match
   - Consider forcing Vite to use specific port

2. **Long-term Solution**:
   - Add port configuration to vite.config.ts
   - Document required environment variables
   - Add validation for environment configuration

**Next Steps**:
1. Determine actual frontend port
2. Update environment configuration
3. Test account creation again
4. Query database to verify accounts

## Key Challenges and Analysis
### Restaurant Settings Management (Priority: High)
- **What**: Admin interface for all customer-facing content
- **Why**: Eliminate hardcoded values and give owner full control
- **Status**: Backend ready, need migration and frontend
- **Challenges**:
  1. Complex form with many sections
  2. Image upload handling
  3. Real-time preview of changes
  4. Validation of opening hours format
  5. Menu selection interface

   - Enhance existing text parser
   - Improve ingredient quantity detection
   - Add support for fractions and mixed numbers

2. **Image & File Import** (Week 5-6)
   - Integrate OCR for recipe images
   - Add PDF parsing capabilities
   - Implement file upload interface

## Research: Recipe Web Scraping Libraries

Based on research into available libraries for recipe web scraping, here are the recommended options for implementing URL import functionality:

### 1. Recipe Schema Extraction Libraries

#### Cheerio + JSON-LD Schema Processing
**Recommendation:** Build a custom solution using Cheerio for HTML parsing and direct JSON-LD extraction.

**Benefits:**
- Cheerio is a lightweight, fast jQuery-like library for server-side HTML parsing
- JSON-LD is the most common and reliable recipe schema format on modern recipe sites
- Direct control over scraping logic and error handling
- No external dependencies on potentially unmaintained libraries

**Example Implementation:**
```javascript
import cheerio from 'cheerio';
import axios from 'axios';

async function scrapeRecipeFromUrl(url) {
  try {
    // Fetch the HTML content from the URL
    const response = await axios.get(url);
    const html = response.data;
    
    // Load HTML into Cheerio
    const $ = cheerio.load(html);
    
    // Extract JSON-LD data
    const jsonLdScript = $('script[type="application/ld+json"]').html();
    
    if (jsonLdScript) {
      const jsonLdData = JSON.parse(jsonLdScript);
      
      // Handle different JSON-LD structures
      const recipeData = Array.isArray(jsonLdData) 
        ? jsonLdData.find(item => item['@type'] === 'Recipe')
        : jsonLdData['@type'] === 'Recipe' 
          ? jsonLdData 
          : jsonLdData['@graph']?.find(item => item['@type'] === 'Recipe');
      
      if (recipeData) {
        return {
          name: recipeData.name,
          description: recipeData.description,
          ingredients: recipeData.recipeIngredient,
          instructions: processInstructions(recipeData.recipeInstructions),
          cookTime: recipeData.cookTime,
          prepTime: recipeData.prepTime,
          totalTime: recipeData.totalTime,
          yield: recipeData.recipeYield,
          image: recipeData.image,
          url: url,
          sourceWebsite: new URL(url).hostname
        };
      }
    }
    
    // Fallback to other extraction methods if needed
    // ...
    
    throw new Error('No recipe data found on page');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Recipe scraping error:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to scrape recipe: ' + error.message);
  }
}

// Helper to process recipe instructions which may be in different formats
function processInstructions(instructions) {
  if (!instructions) return [];
  
  if (typeof instructions === 'string') return [instructions];
  
  if (Array.isArray(instructions)) {
    return instructions.map(instruction => {
      if (typeof instruction === 'string') return instruction;
      if (instruction['@type'] === 'HowToStep') return instruction.text;
      return instruction.text || instruction.name || '';
    }).filter(Boolean);
  }
  
  return [];
}
```

### 2. Existing Recipe Scraper Libraries

#### Option A: recipe-data-scraper
**Description:** Node.js library specifically designed for recipe extraction from websites

**Benefits:**
- Focused solely on recipe data extraction
- Supports microdata and JSON-LD formats
- Active development and 15 GitHub stars
- Clean API with Promise-based usage

**Limitations:**
- Limited website coverage compared to custom solutions
- Possible maintenance concerns for long-term usage

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
import recipeDataScraper from 'recipe-data-scraper';

async function getRecipeFromUrl(url) {
  try {
    const recipe = await recipeDataScraper(url);
    return recipe;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Recipe scraping error:', error);
    throw new Error('Could not find recipe data');
  }
}
```

#### Option B: web-auto-extractor
**Description:** Generic semantic data extractor supporting Schema.org vocabularies

**Benefits:**
- Supports multiple formats (Microdata, RDFa-lite, JSON-LD)
- More general-purpose but can be adapted for recipes
- Mature library with good usage documentation

**Limitations:**
- Not recipe-specific, would require additional parsing logic
- Last published 8 years ago (potential maintenance issues)

### 3. Implementation Approach

#### Recommended Implementation Strategy:

1. **Primary Parser:** Build a custom solution using Cheerio and axios for the most reliable extraction:
   - Focus on JSON-LD extraction first (most common format)
   - Add fallback support for Microdata and RDFa
   - Implement schema.org/Recipe detection

2. **Fallback Option:** Integrate recipe-data-scraper as a fallback:
   - Try custom parser first
   - If it fails, attempt with recipe-data-scraper
   - Provide clear error messages for unsupported sites

3. **Data Mapping Layer:**
   - Create a standardized mapping function to convert extracted data to Kitchen Sync's recipe format
   - Normalize units, times, and measurements during conversion
   - Handle edge cases like missing fields

4. **Error Handling and Validation:**
   - Validate scraped data before saving
   - Provide user feedback for partially extracted recipes
   - Allow manual editing of imported recipes

#### Technical Architecture:

```
Backend:
- RecipeScraperService
  |- extractRecipeFromUrl(url) - Main entry point
  |- scrapers/
     |- jsonLdScraper.js - Primary JSON-LD extractor
     |- microdataScraper.js - Fallback microdata extractor
     |- rdfaScraper.js - Fallback RDFa extractor
     |- externalScraperAdapter.js - Adapter for recipe-data-scraper
  |- utils/
     |- schemaNormalizer.js - Converts schema data to Kitchen Sync format
     |- timeParser.js - Handles ISO 8601 duration format conversion
     |- urlValidator.js - Validates and sanitizes input URLs

Frontend:
- ImportRecipeDialog
  |- URL input field with validation
  |- Import progress indicator
  |- Preview of extracted recipe data
  |- Edit capability for corrections
  |- Error handling UI
```

### 4. Testing Strategy

1. Create a test suite with sample HTML from popular recipe websites
2. Include edge cases (missing fields, malformed data)
3. Compare extraction results against expected outputs
4. Implement periodic checks against top recipe websites to ensure continued functionality

### 5. Future Enhancements

1. **Recipe Site Profiles:**
   - Create site-specific extractors for popular recipe websites
   - Handle custom formats not using standard schemas

2. **Machine Learning Enhancement:**
   - Train a model to extract recipe data from non-structured content
   - Improve extraction accuracy for edge cases

3. **Bulk Import:**
   - Support importing multiple recipes from collection pages

## Menu Builder Module Implementation

### Background and Motivation
The Menu Builder module enables restaurant owners to create, edit, and print professional-looking menus using their existing recipes. This reduces the need to recreate menu items and sections every time the menu is modified.

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Database Schema**: Added models for Menu, MenuSection, and MenuItem with appropriate relations to existing Recipe model
2. **Backend API**: Created RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on menus, sections, and items
3. **Frontend Components**: Developed UI for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting menus
4. **Printing Support**: Designed the module with printing functionality in mind

### Progress Status
- [x] Database schema design and migration SQL creation
- [x] Backend API controllers and routes
- [x] Frontend API service methods
- [x] Frontend menu listing page
- [x] Menu creation/edit form
- [x] Menu sections and items editor component
- [x] Menu detail/preview page with print functionality
- [ ] Recipe selection for menu items (to be implemented)
- [ ] Style customization in the menu editor (to be implemented)
- [ ] Menu PDF export (to be implemented)

### Current Status / Progress Tracking
We've implemented the core functionality of the Menu Builder module. Users can now:
1. View a list of their menus
2. Create new menus with basic information
3. Edit existing menus
4. Add, edit, and delete menu sections
5. Add, edit, and delete menu items within sections
6. Preview menus with formatting based on their settings
7. Print menus directly from the browser

The UI follows a consistent design with the rest of the application and provides a smooth user experience with proper loading states, error handling, and navigation.

Next steps include:
1. Enhancing the menu editor with style customization options
2. Adding a recipe picker to select from existing recipes when creating menu items
3. Implementing PDF export functionality for sharing and offline use
4. Adding logo upload capabilities
5. Improving the print layout with more customization options

### Lessons
- Used FormData for logo uploads to handle file data
- Implemented soft deletion through archiving to preserve menu history
- Created relationships between recipes and menu items to reuse recipe data
- Designed the interface with a tab-based form for better organization of complex data
- Used accordions for an intuitive section/item management interface
- Implemented custom print functionality using window.open() and styled HTML

## Current Architecture Analysis: Customer vs Staff User Separation

### Issue Summary
The current system has a conceptual overlap between:
1. **Staff Users**: Restaurant employees who use KitchenSync to manage the restaurant (recipes, prep, menus, etc.)
2. **Customer Users**: Restaurant patrons who only need access to make/view reservations and their profile

### Current Implementation

#### Database Level
- Single `User` table with `isCustomer` boolean flag
- `CustomerProfile` table for additional customer-specific data
- Roles: SuperAdmin, Admin, Manager, Staff, User (but customers also have roles)

#### Authentication
1. **Staff Authentication**:
   - Uses `/api/users` endpoints
   - `authMiddleware.ts` for general authentication
   - Full access to KitchenSync features

2. **Customer Authentication**:
   - Uses `/api/auth/customer` endpoints
   - `authenticateCustomer.ts` middleware that checks `isCustomer` flag
   - Separate `CustomerAuthContext` in frontend

#### Frontend Separation
- **Staff Portal**: Main app routes under `/` with `MainLayout`
- **Customer Portal**: Routes under `/customer/*` with `CustomerLayout`
- Separate auth contexts (AuthContext vs CustomerAuthContext)

### Problems with Current Approach

1. **Shared User Table**: 
   - Customers and staff in same table creates security/access concerns
   - Risk of privilege escalation if `isCustomer` flag is compromised
   - Confusing data model (why would a customer have a "role"?)

2. **Authentication Complexity**:
   - Two different auth systems for what should be completely separate entities
   - Middleware must constantly check `isCustomer` flag

3. **Conceptual Mixing**:
   - A restaurant customer is NOT a user of KitchenSync
   - They are a customer of the restaurant that happens to use KitchenSync

### Recommended Architecture

#### Option 1: Separate Customer Entity (Recommended)
1. **Database Changes**:
   ```sql
   -- Remove isCustomer from users table
   ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN is_customer;
   
   -- Create separate customers table
   CREATE TABLE customers (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     restaurant_id INTEGER REFERENCES restaurants(id),
     email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     name VARCHAR(255),
     phone VARCHAR(50),
     email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
     updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   
   -- Update reservations to reference customers
   ALTER TABLE reservations 
     DROP COLUMN customer_id,
     ADD COLUMN customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id);
   ```

2. **Benefits**:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - No risk of privilege escalation
   - Simpler authentication logic
   - Scalable for multi-restaurant future

3. **API Structure**:
   ```
   /api/auth/staff/* - Staff authentication
   /api/auth/customer/* - Customer authentication
   /api/admin/* - Staff-only endpoints
   /api/customer/* - Customer-only endpoints
   /api/public/* - Public endpoints (menus, etc.)
   ```

#### Option 2: Role-Based Access Control (Current Enhancement)
1. **Keep single User table but enforce strict separation**:
   - Add `user_type` enum: 'STAFF' | 'CUSTOMER'
   - Remove role inheritance between types
   - Strict middleware enforcement

2. **Challenges**:
   - Still conceptually mixed
   - More complex middleware
   - Harder to scale

### Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Create new customer infrastructure
   - New customers table
   - New auth endpoints
   - Keep existing for compatibility

2. **Phase 2**: Migrate existing customers
   - Script to move customer users to new table
   - Update reservations foreign keys
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Phase 3**: Remove old infrastructure
   - Remove isCustomer flag
   - Clean up mixed authentication
   - Update documentation

### Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Design new customer database schema
- [ ] Create customer auth controllers
- [ ] Build customer-specific middleware
- [ ] Update reservation/order models

## Production Migration Progress (2025-05-25)

### Completed Tasks
1. âœ… Created comprehensive migration plan in scratchpad
2. âœ… Created production-safe migration scripts:
   - `production-customer-migration.js` - Main migration with dry-run, execute, and rollback modes
   - `production-backup.js` - JSON backup script for pre-migration safety
   - `production-preflight-check.js` - Read-only verification script
3. âœ… Created detailed migration guide: `backend/docs/PRODUCTION_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
4. âœ… Fixed schema compatibility issues:
   - User model uses `name` instead of `firstName`/`lastName`
   - No `isActive` field in User model
   - No email verification fields in User model
5. âœ… Created feature branch: `feature/customer-user-separation-production`

### Script Features
- **Safety First**: All scripts default to dry-run mode
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed JSON logs with timestamps
- **Rollback Capability**: Can undo migration if issues found
- **Production Checks**: Multiple confirmations for production changes
- **Idempotent**: Scripts can be run multiple times safely

### Next Steps
1. [ ] Test all scripts on local database
2. [ ] Commit all changes to feature branch
3. [ ] Create staging environment for testing
4. [ ] Update backend code for compatibility layer
5. [ ] Run full test suite
6. [ ] Schedule production migration window

### Important Notes
- Production database uses different schema (name vs firstName/lastName)
- Customer tables partially exist in production (customer_profiles)
- Reservations table already has customer_id column
- 3 customers need to be migrated from users table
- All scripts require explicit confirmation for production execution

### Migration Safety Checklist
- [ ] Backup production database
- [ ] Test on staging environment
- [ ] Review all uncommitted changes
- [ ] Ensure rollback plan is ready
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours post-migration

## Production Fix: Reservation Foreign Key (2025-05-26)

### Issue Fixed
Customer reservations were failing with 500 error because:
1. The `reservations.customer_id` foreign key was pointing to `users` table instead of `customers` table
2. The `reservations.user_id` field was NOT NULL, preventing customer-only reservations
3. The customerReservationController wasn't using the `customerId` field due to type mismatch

### Changes Made
1. **Database Changes**:
   - Fixed foreign key constraint: `reservations.customer_id` now references `customers(id)`
   - Made `user_id` nullable to allow customer reservations without staff assignment
   - Created and ran `fix-reservation-foreign-key.js` script

2. **Schema Updates**:
   - Updated Prisma schema to mark `userId` as optional (`Int?`)
   - Regenerated Prisma client to update TypeScript types

3. **Code Updates**:
   - Updated `customerReservationController` to use `customerId` field
   - Removed requirement for `userId` in customer reservations

### Result
Customer reservations now work correctly. Customers can create reservations through the customer portal without errors.
