   - Customer-specific middleware
   - Fixed cross-authentication issues

## Technical Stack

### Database
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Single-tenant architecture (MVP)
- Restaurant ID = 1 for all operations
- Separate users (staff) and customers tables

### Authentication
- JWT-based auth for both staff and customers
- Separate auth contexts and storage
- Role hierarchy: SuperAdmin > Admin > User
- Customer accounts separate from staff

### Email Service
- SendGrid for transactional emails
- Templates for all user communications
- Test scripts for development
- Environment-based configuration

### Image Management
- Cloudinary for all uploads
- Automatic optimization
- Public ID tracking for updates/deletes

### Frontend Architecture
- React with TypeScript
- Material-UI components
- Separate layouts for admin/customer
- Theme provider for dynamic styling
- React Query for data fetching

## Environment Variables Required

### Backend
```
DATABASE_URL=
JWT_SECRET=
SESSION_SECRET=
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
SENDGRID_API_KEY=
FROM_EMAIL=
FRONTEND_URL=
```

### Frontend
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

## API Structure

### Public Endpoints
- `/api/public/*` - Restaurant info, menus
- `/api/auth/customer/*` - Customer authentication

### Customer Endpoints
- `/api/customer/*` - Customer-specific features
- `/api/customer/reservations` - Reservation management

### Staff Endpoints
- `/api/users/*` - Staff authentication
- `/api/recipes/*`, `/api/menus/*`, etc. - Restaurant management
- `/api/admin/*` - Admin-only features (NEW)

### Admin Endpoints (NEW v2.11.1)
- `/api/admin/customers` - Customer management
- `/api/admin/customers/analytics` - Customer analytics
- `/api/admin/staff` - Staff management
- `/api/admin/staff/analytics` - Staff analytics

## Deployment Notes
- Auto-deploy enabled on Render
- Main branch triggers deployment
- Database hosted on Render PostgreSQL
- Static frontend on Render Static Site
- Environment variables must be set in Render dashboard

## Version History
- v2.11.1: Admin Dashboard, email testing infrastructure
- v2.11.0: Customer/user separation, production fixes
- v2.10.0: Content Management, Restaurant Settings, Customer Portal
- v2.9.0: TableFarm initial implementation
- v2.8.0: MenuBuilder enhancements

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. Single restaurant support only (multi-tenant deferred)
2. No payment processing
3. No real-time updates (WebSocket support planned)
4. Basic reservation system (no table management yet)
5. Email reminders not implemented

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete customer detail modal implementation
2. Build analytics dashboard with charts
3. Implement staff management UI
4. Add export functionality for customer data
5. Create bulk operations for admin tasks

### Future Enhancements
1. ChefRail implementation
2. WebSocket for real-time updates
3. Email reminder system
4. Advanced reservation features
5. Multi-restaurant support
6. Payment processing
7. Mobile apps
8. API documentation

## Development Guidelines

### Database Safety
- ALWAYS use `npm run dev:local` for development
- NEVER use production database for testing
- Run `npm run db:check` before any operations
- Create backups before migrations

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches for new work
- Test thoroughly before merging
- Tag releases with version numbers
- Document all breaking changes

### Testing
- Test all features locally first
- Use staging environment when possible
- Test email flows with test script
- Verify customer/staff separation

## Lessons Learned
- Always check for hardcoded constants when implementing dynamic features
- Keep maintenance scripts separate from application code
- Document stashed changes and branch purposes for future reference
- Maintain consistent API endpoint paths across service methods
- Ensure proxy configuration in Vite points to the correct backend server port
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Be aware of how path prefixes are applied in the API service configuration - avoid double prefixing
- Ensure type consistency between frontend and backend, especially for IDs and foreign keys
- When implementing complex systems, document the architecture and user roles first
- Separate customer-facing and internal-facing interfaces from the start
- Plan for multi-tenancy early in the project to avoid major refactoring later
- Start with single-tenant MVP to validate concept before adding complexity
- Use clear restaurant branding in customer-facing interfaces
- Implement multi-step forms for better UX in reservation flow
- Create comprehensive settings models to avoid hardcoding throughout the app
- Always regenerate Prisma client after schema changes
- Always use `npm run dev:local` in the backend
- CORS Configuration - ensure credentials: true for JWT auth
- Read the file before you try to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- Separate Customer and Staff Authentication to avoid cross-authentication issues
- Customer Auth Context must be initialized properly to persist across routes
- Database Safety - NEVER use production database for development
- Use visual distinctions between prod and dev environments
- Create placeholder components to avoid build errors during development
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all API responses

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Status Update (2025-05-26)
- Fixed the production API URL issue in both `adminApi.ts` and `config.ts`
- Both files now correctly use `https://kitchen-sync-api.onrender.com` when in production
- Changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub
- Render should automatically deploy the changes since auto-deploy is enabled
- Once deployed, the admin dashboard should work correctly in production
