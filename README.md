## üì¶ Installation & Development

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL database
- Cloudinary account for image management

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kitchen-sync.git
cd kitchen-sync
npm run install:all

# Set up environment variables (see Environment Setup below)

# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Start development servers (ALWAYS use these commands from project root)
npm run dev:all        # Start both backend and frontend
npm run backend        # Start backend only (LOCAL database)
npm run frontend       # Start frontend only
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Development Commands
**ALWAYS run commands from the project root directory:**
- `npm run backend` - Start backend with LOCAL database (safe for development)
- `npm run frontend` - Start frontend dev server
- `npm run dev:all` - Start both backend and frontend
- `npm run db:studio` - Open Prisma Studio
- `npm run db:check` - Check multi-tenant status

**NEVER run `npm run dev` in the backend directory** (it uses PRODUCTION database)

### Environment Setup

#### Backend (.env.local for development)
```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-local-postgresql-url"
JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"
SESSION_SECRET="your-session-secret"
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloud-name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
SENDGRID_API_KEY="your-sendgrid-key"
FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourrestaurant.com"
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="your-stripe-secret-key"
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-webhook-secret"
```

```bash
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:3001/api"
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your-stripe-publishable-key"
```

### Production Environment
- **Backend**: Deployed on Render.com with PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Static site deployment with automatic builds

### Database Safety
- `backend/.env.local` = LOCAL database (safe to use)
