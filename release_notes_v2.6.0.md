# Kitchen Sync v2.6.0 - Recipe Thumbnails

## Overview
This release enhances the recipe list view with visual thumbnails, making it easier to recognize recipes at a glance. By leveraging Cloudinary's image transformation capabilities, we've added optimized thumbnails that maintain performance while providing a more engaging user experience.

## New Features
- **Recipe Thumbnails**: Added visual thumbnails to the recipe list for quick recognition
- **Cloudinary Transformations**: Implemented on-the-fly image optimization for thumbnails
- **Fallback Icons**: Added recipe icons for recipes without photos
- **Responsive Design**: Thumbnails properly sized for all screen resolutions
- **Improved Visual Experience**: Enhanced recipe list with a more engaging layout

## Technical Improvements
- **Image Optimization**: Used Cloudinary's automatic quality and resize transformations
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript definitions for better development experience
- **Performance Optimization**: Small thumbnail sizes ensure fast page loading
- **Consistent UI**: Standardized avatar sizes and spacing for visual harmony

## How It Works
The thumbnail system intelligently transforms recipe photos using Cloudinary's URL parameters:
- `w_80,h_80,c_fill`: Creates 80Ã—80px thumbnails with smart cropping
- `q_auto`: Automatically optimizes image quality for performance

## Try It Out
Browse your recipe collection to see the new visual thumbnails in action. Each recipe now shows a thumbnail preview in the list view, making it easier to find the recipe you're looking for at a glance.
