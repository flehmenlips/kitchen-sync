# Kitchen Sync v2.7.0 - Recipe Thumbnails in Prep Board

## Overview
This release extends the recipe thumbnail feature to the prep board, enhancing visual recognition of recipe tasks in the AgileChef module. Recipe thumbnails are now displayed in the task details drawer, providing visual context for prep tasks linked to recipes.

## New Features
- **Prep Board Thumbnails**: Added recipe thumbnails to the task details drawer for recipe-linked tasks
- **Consistent Styling**: Used the same thumbnail styling across the app for visual consistency
- **Fallback Icons**: Added recipe icons for tasks linked to recipes without photos
- **Improved Task Details**: Enhanced the layout of recipe information in the task drawer
- **Visual Context**: Provides immediate visual recognition of recipes in the prep workflow

## Technical Improvements
- **Reusable Thumbnail Logic**: Extracted and reused the same Cloudinary transformation logic
- **Responsive Design**: Thumbnails properly sized for all screen resolutions
- **Performance Optimization**: Used Cloudinary's automatic optimization for prep board thumbnails
- **Compact Layout**: Reorganized task details to efficiently display information alongside thumbnails

## How It Works
When viewing task details for a recipe-linked task in the prep board:
1. The recipe thumbnail is displayed prominently at the top of the recipe details section
2. For recipes without photos, a placeholder icon is shown
3. Recipe details (name, description, and metadata) are displayed alongside the thumbnail
4. The same Cloudinary transformations ensure consistent thumbnail quality and size

## User Experience Benefits
